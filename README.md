# Random Source Codes

Never be bored again! Staring at your screen and just scrolling the great world wide web?
Would you rather read through some code from your favorite open source project?

Just like Wikipedia's [Random Article](), [randomsource.codes](https://www.randomsource.codes) will
open a random file from one of the projects.

Just go to [randomsource.codes](https://www.randomsource.codes) (this requires you are logged into your GitHub account)
and it will set up an environment for you to play around with the code. Maybe you will find a typo or a bug, you never know!

## Supported Projects
